Welcome to our blog showing the progression of our project in the class "HCI For Mixed Reality" of Telecom Paris.

# Step 0 : Installation

To begin everything, we installed unity, the software that we're going to use for the development of the project.

We opened Unity Hub, and went to Installs, then Install Editor, then download archive.

We chose to use the 6000.2.12f1 version, as one of us already had this version installed and it was compatible with the most recent tools for VR development.

We made sure to include Android Build support, to be able to run the project on most VR headsets.
